# Predicting loan outcomes from customer data with machine learning

Using a set of mock customer data, the task is to predict outcomes of loans: Whether they will default or not.

First, the dataset is analysed and features are selected. Then a variety of models are trained with a very concise amount of code.

The two best performing models are tuned further and saved for use to infer outcome probabilities from future datapoints.
